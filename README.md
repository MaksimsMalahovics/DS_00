# Big O: O(n^2)

## Task
In this task, you are required to implement a function called `print_items(n)`.

### Function Description
This function takes one integer argument, `n`, and prints out a pair of numbers `(i, j)` for every possible combination of `i` and `j` in the range of `0` up to but not including `n`.

### Implementation Details
- Each pair `(i, j)` is printed on a new line.
- `i` and `j` iterate over the range independently, so every combination of `i` and `j` in the range should be printed.

### Expected Output
The output of the function should be a series of pairs, printed one after the other, each on a new line. The pairs should be printed in the order that they are generated by the nested loops.

#### Example Output for `print_items(3)`:
0 0

0 1

0 2

1 0

1 1

1 2

2 0

2 1

2 2


### Additional Notes
- The pairs are generated by the nested loops, with `i` taking on every value from `0` to `n - 1` in the outer loop, and `j` taking on every value from `0` to `n - 1` in the inner loop for each value of `i`.
- The goal of this function is to print all the pairs `(i, j)` where `i` and `j` are in the range of `0` up to `n - 1`.

### Submission
you should store your program in `result.py` file and commit it to server.
